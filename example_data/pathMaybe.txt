MICRO: 6 H&E (including 3 deeper-cut slides on block 3A)\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\n\n1. Ascending colon, biopsy: Tubulovillous adenoma(s).\n\n2. Distal ascending colon, biopsy: Tubular adenoma.\n\n3. Rectal mass, biopsy: Colorectal mucosa with markedly dysplastic glands, suspicious for invasive carcinoma. Please see comment.\n\nCOMMENT: The degree of cytologic atypia observed in the rather small specimen from the rectal mass clearly exceeds that usually associated with the classifications of adenoma or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Though this atypia along with some of the ancillary histologic features raise the concern for the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma, this biopsy itself does not appear to unequivocally contain invasive carcinoma.\n\nCONSULT (#3): Drs. J. Cesar and C. Cheffe\n\nCPT: 88305x3
Microscopic examination performed.\n\nDIAGNOSIS: #1 Colon, ascending, biopsy: Tubular adenoma. No evidence of high grade dysplasia.\n\n#2 Colon, sigmoid, biopsy: Mucosal hyperplasia.\n\n#3 Rectum, biopsy: Intramucosal adenocarcinoma suspicious of submucosal invasion, fragments. Margins cannot be evaluated.\n\nNOTE: The specimens were delivered to the lab on February 21, 2021.\n\nDr. Boo was notified of the diagnosis on February 24, 2021.\n\nCPT CODE: 88305
COLON, SIGMOID, BIOPSY:\n	TUBULAR ADENOMA WITH INTRAMUCOSAL CARCINOMA. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF INVASION THROUGH THE MUSCULARIS MUCOSA. THERE IS ADENOMATOUS TISSUE WITH DYSPLASIA WITHIN 1MM (0.1 CM) OF THE BASE OF THE POLYP. THE FULGURATION LINE IN THE STALK IS FREE OF TUMOR.
Sections show a polypoid colonic mucosa consisting of adenomatous polyp with 4 areas where these glands are very crowded with gland-inside gland formation as well as marked anaplasia of these glandular architecture which is consistent with adenocarcinoma in-situ. The stalk of the polyp is lined by benign colonic mucosa therefore it appears that this polyp is completely removed.\n\nNOTE: Clinical correlation and close follow-up is recommended.\n\nDIAG: Colon polyp: Adenomatous polyp with foci of adenocarcinoma in-situ.\n	Resection margin of the stalk is negative for carcinoma.
A. Rectum, biopsy:\n	-Adenocarcinoma in situ, see comment 1.\n\nB. Small intestine, ileum, biopsies:\n	-Chronic inflammation with increased eosinophils, see comment 2.\n\nComment 1: This superficial biopsy does not contain stroma, so invasion cannot be assessed. This case was shown at Consensus Conference.\n\nComment 2: These findings are non-specific and clinical correlation is recommended.
SPECIMEN #1 - COLON, DESCENDING COLON POLYP, BIOPSY: HYPERPLASTIC POYLP.\n\nSPECIMEN #2 - COLON, CLINICALLY CECAL POLYP, BIOPSY: ADENOMATOUS POLYP WITH FOCAL HIGH GRADE DYSPLASIA (SEE COMMENT).\n\nSPECIMEN #3 - COLON, CLINICALLY SIGMOID, BIOPSY: SUBMUCOSAL LIPOMA.\n\nCOMMENT: This is a polyp showing focal high grade dysplasia. Invasive adenocarcinoma cannot be ruled out because of the fragmented nature of the specimen.\n\nDr. Michael notified 24 Apr 01 @ 2:15\n\n Report dictated 3/16/12\n idk:ke#12345
Diagnosis\n\nDescending colon, mass, biopsy:\n - AT LEAST INTRAMUCOSAL ADENOCARCINOMA\n\nComment: Dr. Liu concurs with the diagnosis of malignancy. GI physician was notified on March 9, 2016.
DIAGNOSIS\n\nA. ASCENDING COLON, POLYP, POLYPECTOMY\n	- TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA WITH MULTIFOCAL SUPERFICIAL HIGH GRADE DYSPLASIA (CARCINOMA IN SITU), HAGGITT GRADE 0 (SEE COMMENT)\n\nB. SIGMOID COLON, POLYP, POLYPECTOMY\n	- TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA WITH SUPERFICIAL ATYPIA\n\n\nComment: Dr. Key concurs with the findings. Dr. Verita notified on 5/29/2022 at 10:00AM
The permanent section of the frozen section material and the additional sections from the remaining specimen, show sessile tubulovillous adenoma. The tumor shows focal areas of high grade dysplasia. No definitive invasive lesion is identified.\n\nDIAGNOSIS: Villous adenoma with high grade dysplasia. No definite invasive carcinoma is identified in the examined sections.\n\nNOTE: The frozen section and the permanent section diagnosis agree.
 A. CECAL POLYPS\n	Tubular adenoma(1)\n	Hyperplastic polyp(1)\n\n B. TRANSVERSE COLON POLYPS\n	Tubular adenomas(2); the larger with two areas of high grade dysplasia (carcinoma in-situ). see comment.\n\nComment: the adenoma with high grade dysplasia shows cautery artefact and fragmentation; invasion of stalk cannot be ruled out nor can adequacy of excision be evaluated.\n\n2B/11H&E\n\nmnz
DIAGNOSIS:\n\nA. COLON, SIDMOID, BIOPSY (OUTSIDE CASE A-12-1234A):\n - TUBULAR ADENOMA X2.\n\nB. RECTUM, POLYP, BIOPSY (OUTSIDE CASE A-12-1234B):\n - INTRAMUCOSAL ADENOCARCINOMA ARISING IN A TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA (SEE COMMENT).\n\nComment: In specimen B, the margins and depth of the tumor cannot be evaluated due to fragmentation of the specimen. Case reviewed in Consensus Conference on 09/18/2022.
Lesions 'A' through 'D' are all tubulovillous adenomas. Lesion 'D' in the cecum also has adenocarcinoma in-situ arising within it.\n\nDr. Wooly notified on 5-13-12 at 12:45 p.m. that adenocarcinoma in-situ is present but that no invasive tumor is identified and that all seven lymph nodes are negative.
DIAGNOSIS: Snared polyp @ 30 cm:\n	TUBULAR ADENOMA WITH FOCAL CARCINOMA IN-SITU.\n	No invasive component identified.\n\nCPT CODE: 88305
DIAGNOSIS: TUBULAR ADENOMA WITH FOCAL ADENOCARCINOMA IN-SITU; CANNOT RULE-OUT INVASION DUE TO FRAGMENTED AND SUPERFICIAL NATURE OF THE SPECIMEN.\n\n	T: 02/22/02 D: 02/22/02wjc\n	JAY A. MCCABE, M.D.
