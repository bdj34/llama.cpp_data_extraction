Right colon, resection:\n	- Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated.\n	- Tumor size: 5 x 3 x 1 cm.\n	- Tumor invades through muscularis propria, into pericolonic fibroadipose tissue.\n	- Resection margins free of involvement (8.5 cm to distal; 5.5 cm to proximal margin).\n	- Nine lymph nodes, negative for metastasis.\n	- pT3 N0 Mx\nComment: The tumor demonstrates a prominent mucinous component; however, it is less than 50% of the tumor and therefore is not classified as a mucinous adenocarcinoma.
A. Step sections are examined through a mucosal biopsy of duodenum. The mucosal surface shows a tall villous architecture without atrophy, atypia, or ulceration. The lamina propria contains appropriate numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells and there is no increase in inflammation. Giardia organisms are not identified along the mucosal surface. Normal intestinal mucin production is present. No malignancy is identified.\n\nB. Step sections are examined through a mucosal biopsy of the stomach. The surface mucosal layer is intact and no ulceration is identified. There is no gland atrophy or atypia. The superficial lamina propria contains a mild increase in chronic inflammatory cells. No acute inflammation is seen.\n\nC. Sections are of an invasive moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma with overlying adenomatous change with focal high-grade dysplasia and mucosal ulceration.\n\nD. Step sections are of colonic mucosa. The surface shows areas of adenomatous change. There are tubular glands lined by cells with nuclear elongation and hyperchromatism. No prominent pleomorphism is identified. The lamina propria contains very mild chronic inflammation. Mild/low grade glandular dysplasia is present. No malignancy is identified.
Specimen:\n	Sigmoid colon mass\n\nClinical History: None given.\n\nGross Description:\n The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient name and social security number and additionally labeled 'SIGMOID COLON'. It consists of multiple fragments of tissue measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm in aggregate, entirely submitted in 1 cassette between sponges.\n\nComment: No lymph-vascular invasion is identified in the current specimen. Depth of invasion cannot be determined on the biopsy material. Immunohistochemical staining for mismatch repair protein expression has been ordered and the results will be reported in a separate addendum.\n\n A preliminary diagnosis was given to Dr. Soledad on 6/3/2026 by Dr. Jolene.\n\nDrs.

SPEC. 1. Sections show portions of colonic mucosa and submucosa. There are several foci of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\nSPEC. 2. Sections show a pedunculated tubular adenoma. There is no evidence of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy. The base of the polyp is covered by benign colonic mucosa. Spec. 1 was seen daily case conference with Drs. Boo, Ajari, Iwo, Raul and Mari.

DIAGNOSIS:\n\nA. COLON MASS, BIOPSY:\n	- INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED (SEE COMMENT).\n\nComment: Case reviewed in Consensus Conference on 5/14/2024. Dr. Ben Beinoff was notified of the results via phone call in 5/14/2024 at 3:00 pm. DNA mismatch repair testing is performed and the results are reported below.\n\n*This IHC test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Anatomic Pathology Laboratory at North Texas Veteran Health Care System. It has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research purposes.\n\nDNA Mismatch Repair Biomarker Testing\nDNA MISMATCH REPAIR TESTING\nSpecimen Site: colon\nTesting Performed on Block Number(s): A2\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) Results for Mismatch Repair (MMR) Proteins:\nMLH1 Result: Intact Nuclear Expression\nMSH2 Result: Intact Nuclear Expression\nMSH6 Result: Intact Nuclear Expression\nPMS2 Result: Intact Nuclear Expression\nMismatch Repair (MMR) Interpretation: No loss of nuclear expression of MMR proteins: No evidence of deficient mismatch repair (low probability of MSI-H)\nMicrosatellite Instability (MSI) Interpretation: MIS-Stable (MSS)\nThe presence of MIS-H / deficient mismatch repair may also be an indication for additional testing for Lynch syndrome and genetic counseling.\nHeterogeneous expression of MLH1 and PMS2 has been infrequently encountered in endometrial carcinomas (up to 3% of cases). The incidence of heterogeneous expression in other cancer types and its impact on predicting sensitivity to checkpoint inhibition is not currently known.

The tissue for examination is highly fragmented but has ulcerated adenomatous epithelium with one tissue fragment showing glandular structures infiltrating smooth muscle, which in conjunction with endoscopic impression, is compatible for invasive adenocarcinoma. High grade dysplasia (intramucosal adenocarcinoma) is also seen in some of the fragments.
