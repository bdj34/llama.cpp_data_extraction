2.5cm ASCENDING COLON POLYP:\n-TUBULAR ADENOMA WITH PATCHY LOW GRADE DYSPLASIA. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA.\nAS/yl 2/15/18
 SPEC. 1. Sections show a portion of colonic mucosa with a small focus of acute inflammation. There is no evidence of adenomatous or hyperplastic change. Spec. 2. Sections show multiple fragments of colonic mucosa, some of which show localized acute inflammation and cryptitis. Two biopsy fragments show hyperplastic change. There is no evidence of dysplasia, adenomatous change or malignancy. SPEC. 3. Sections show a tubulovillous adenoma with moderate cytologic atypia. There is no evidence of invasive carcinoma. GN/lm\n\n	COMMENT: Spec. 1 and 2 show focal acute colitis including cryptitis. The etiology and significance of this acute inflammation cannot be determined based on histology alone. Clinical correlation is recommended.
(Dr. B. Patel; 5/10/2010)\nThe microscopic examination of the sections of the random gastric biopsy shows gastric mucosa with mild chronic inflammation with focal activity. There is a single lymphoid aggregate identified. There is no evidence of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy. There is intestinal metaplasia seen. Multiple deeper sections are examined and show the same.\nImmunohistochemical stain for H. Pylori is performed with appropriately reactive control and is negative.\n\nThe microscopic examination of the transverse colon polyps shows fragments of tubular adenoma and tubulovillous adenoma. No evidence of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma seen.
A. Colon, random biopsy: Colonic mucosa with moderate chronic inflammation of the lamina propria, focal cryptitis. Foci of increased intraepithelial lymphocytes noted.\nThese features could be seen in lymphocytic colitis. No granuloma or carcinoma seen.	See comment.\n\nB. Colon, prominent fold hepatic flexure, biopsy: Colonic mucosa with moderate chronic inflammation of the lamina propria and focal areas of increased intraepithelial lymphocytes notes. These features could be seen in lymphocytic colitis. No granuloma or carcinoma seen. See comment.\n\nCOMMENT: Both submitted biopsies show moderate chronic inflammation of the lamina propria and areas of increased intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltrate. These changes could be seen un lymphocytic colitis. Clinical and endoscopic correlation if recommended. No granuloma or carcinoma seen.
Microscopic examination performed. HH/lm\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\n	Colon, sigmoid, polyp, biopsy--\n	- 4 fragments of tubular adenoma with no evidence of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma
 LEFT COLON, BIOPSY: MINUTE FRAGMENT OF COLONIC MUCOSA WITH\n REGENERATIVE CHANGES AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. NO ACTIVE COLITIS SEEN.\n FEATURES OF TUBULAR ADENOMA OR CARCINOMA ARE ABSENT.
M13-123		LOBSTER, LARRY T	SSN: 123-45-6789\n\nSections of the ascending colon polyp display fragments of colonic mucosa showing non-complex crypt architecture with low-grade dysplastic features including pseudo-stratification, particularly of the superficial epithelium, and enlarged, hyper chromatic nuclei. No evidence of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma is seen.
